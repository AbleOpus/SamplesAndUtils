# SamplesAndUtils
A large sum of projects consisting of sample code from tutorials, or small utilities. This is mostly older code refactored to an extent. If you expect to find something here but cannot, contact me. This code is posted here for browsability.

## MorseChallenge
Presents words in morse code through system beeps. The appropriate word then needs to be inputted correctly.
## MorseCodeRain
A game that drops morse codes into a blue sea. The idea is to input the right character for the falling codes before they reach the sea. If a code is guess wrong or reaches the sea, a point is subtracted. If a code is guess right, a point is added.
## MsgSandBox
Provides a utility for logging, viewing, and filtering window messages that are processed by a dummy Form.
## ParticleGenerator
Provides a graphics example that draws blips with the specified density, radius, and color.

## SpeechConsole
A console application that listens for certain commands. It listens for numbers 0-100, “exit”, and “close”. Say “exit” or “close” to close the application.
## TicTacToe
Provides a 3x3 tic-tac-toe game. Unfortunately, the computer player loses its intelligence when the grid is set to something greater than 3x3.
