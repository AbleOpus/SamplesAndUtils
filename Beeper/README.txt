Beeper is for playing a sequence of notes using the console speakers 
(on modern machines its your externals). Each note contains info on the 
following: 

Frequency: The pitch of the note
Duration: The length of the note
Pause: The length of the silence after the note

Ex. (500-100-140) 

The sequence notes can be spaced from each other and the pause is optional.
Each note must be wrapped in parenthesis.

The speed multiplier alters the playing speed of the loaded song. The lower 
the number the faster the song plays.

The defaults in the parser typically relate to the default values for parsing letter
notes. I parse only the simplest letter notes and not much info can be salvaged.
Though some letter notes will have punctuation to indicate pauses. This is 
adjustable through the numeric up down boxes.
